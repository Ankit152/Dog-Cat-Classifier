# Dog Cat Classifier

A CNN model that classifies Cats and Dogs.

The model is trained in 3000 images of Cats and Dogs. And there are 300 images for Cats and Dogs in the validation set.

The original dataset consists of 25000 images of Cats and Dogs i.e. 12500 images for each class. But for a running example how CNN works I have taken very lesser number of images.
